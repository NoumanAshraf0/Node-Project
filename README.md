## Guidelines

In this project, I am using the azure artifacts. In order to create azure artifacts, we need to have a feed created under the "Artifacts" section.
For this specific project i.e. NPM, .npmrc file should be created in the project directory where package.json file lies. In .npmrc file we define the feed and registry 
that we have created. 
Script to publish the artifacts is in the azure-pipelines.yaml.
